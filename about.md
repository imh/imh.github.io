I'm a San Francisco based data scientist working at [Stitch Fix](http://multithreaded.stitchfix.com/) on the Stylist Algorithms and Research team.
Previously, I've worked on machine learning, statistics, and optimization problems at cool places like [Swift Navigation](http://www.swiftnav.com/), [Study.com](http://study.com/), [Joby Aviation](http://www.jobyaviation.com/)/[Joby Energy](http://www.jobyenergy.com/), and the [Santa Cruz Institute for Particle Physics](http://scipp.ucsc.edu/).

The blog is mostly for me to practice writing more.
I'm nervous/embarrased about keeping anything public facing, but it's good motivation and  we'll see how it goes.
Hopefully I'll eventually have things actually worth reading!

My CV is [here](/assets/cv.pdf).
