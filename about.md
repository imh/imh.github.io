The site used to be for me to practice writing more, but now it's just a handy place to keep my loose notes accessible to myself and others.

I'm a San Francisco based ML research engineer working at [Ought](https://ought.org/), where we make [Elicit](https://elicit.org/), a scientific research assistant.
Previously, I've worked on machine learning, statistics, and optimization problems at cool places like [Stitch Fix](http://multithreaded.stitchfix.com/), [Swift Navigation](http://www.swiftnav.com/), [Study.com](http://study.com/), [Joby Aviation](http://www.jobyaviation.com/)/[Joby Energy](http://www.jobyenergy.com/), and the [Santa Cruz Institute for Particle Physics](http://scipp.ucsc.edu/).


My CV is [here](/assets/cv.pdf).
